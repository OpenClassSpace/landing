# Open Class Space Landing
Main repo for development of the landing page hosted in the repo `OpenClassSpace.github.io`.
This is mainly just an Express application to ease development of the landing page, but
technically not necessary as it isn't hosted as a NodeJS project but on Github Pages.

## Getting Started
Pull the repo and install node packages by:

```
  npm install
```

Run the node server by calling

```
  npm start
```

## Gulp
We use gulp to automate minifying and providing compiled views for our Github Pages repo.
Do checkout `gulpfile.js` for a rundown of what tasks are provided and what you can do. It
should be fairly well documented (the dream), so you should have no problemo :).
