# Open Class Space Landing
Main repo for development of the landing page hosted in the repo `OpenClassSpace.github.io`.
This is mainly just an Express application to ease development of the landing page, but
technically not necessary as it isn't hosted as a NodeJS project but on Github Pages.

## Getting Started
Pull the repo and install node packages by:

```
  npm install
```

Run the node server by calling

```
  npm start
```
